# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This repository contains two implementations of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game:

1. A web-based version using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. A terminal-based version using Python.

## Web Implementation

### Overview

A bot challenges the user to a game of Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The rules are simple:

- **Rock** beats **Scissors**.
- **Scissors** beats **Paper**.
- **Paper** beats **Rock**.

The scoreboard keeps track of the scores for both the player and the bot. The game is played by clicking on the respective buttons.

### How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Use the provided buttons to make your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The game result will be displayed immediately, updating the scores as you play.

### Files

- **HTML**: The main structure of the game can be found in `index.html`.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic is in `js/main.js`.
- **CSS**: Styles can be found in `css/main.css`.

## Python Terminal Implementation

### How to Use

1. Run the provided Python script in a terminal.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to make your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
3. The game result will be displayed immediately.

### Files

- **Python**: Game logic can be found in the respective Python file.

## Future Implementations

- **Stylish Front-End Interface**: The CSS file for the web version is currently empty. I intend to enhance the game with a stylish and interactive front-end interface. Anyone looking to contribute in this area is warmly welcomed and much appreciated!

## What I Learned

- **Web Development**: Through building the web implementation, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to integrate them seamlessly to create an interactive web game.
- **Python Programming**: By implementing the game in Python, I deepened my understanding of Python's syntax, its in-built functions like `random.choice()`, and user input handling.

- **Game Logic**: Designing the logic for the game helped me practice conditional statements and understand the importance of structuring the game flow.

- **UI/UX**: By designing the interface for the web version, I learned the importance of creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making the game more engaging.

Happy gaming!
